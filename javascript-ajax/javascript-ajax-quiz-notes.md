## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is AJAX?
It's a programming practice of building complex, dynamic webpages using XMLHttpRequest
- What does the AJAX acronym stand for?
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- Which object is built into the browser for making HTTP requests in JavaScript?
XMLHttpRequest
- What event is fired by `XMLHttpRequest` objects when they are finished loading the data from the server?
load will fire when data is successfully loaded, but loadend will fire regardless if successful
- **Bonus Question**: An `XMLHttpRequest` object has an `addEventListener()` method just like DOM elements. How is it possible that they both share this functionality?
they are both created using the big Object, so they'll both get the .addEventListener() method on the prototype chain

## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does the `new` operator do?
new operator lets us create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types
- What property of JavaScript functions can store shared behavior for instances created with `new`?
protoptype
- What does the `instanceof` operator do?
it tests whether an object is an instance of a constructor(class) by seeing if the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of the object, ie toyota can be an instance of the Car constructor (Car.protoype will be in toyota's prototype chain, or Object.getPrototypeOf(toyota) === Car.prototype)

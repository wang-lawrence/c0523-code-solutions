- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
the name of the function followed by paranthesis with the appropriate arguments passed in

definition uses the function keyword to declare it and contains the code block wrapped in {}, a call only has the name of the function with the approporate argument
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
parameter is a placeholder in the defintion of a function and has no value, argument is a real value passed into the function call
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
they allow the functions to be more flexible and responsive to our inputs

## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do controlled components differ from uncontrolled components?
The values of controlled components are managed by the state whereas the values of the uncontrolled components are managed by the componenet itself internally by the web browser
- What are some advantages of using uncontrolled components?
Uncontrolled components are easier to implement, no need to use state, could perform faster if there's a bottleneck somewhere
- What are some advantages of using controlled components?
Controlled components can rerender the page with the input value as it changes, so you can reuse that value somewhere else on the page and render it right away, you can also adjust the input value in other ways by utizling state in other areas

if it's a simple form then uncontrolled seems easier, but I can see controlled being more flexible for more complex forms

value and onChange handler

React Hook Form, Formik, React Final Form

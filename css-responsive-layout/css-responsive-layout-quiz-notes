## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
the point at which a media query is introduced in order to remedy a breakdown in the content layout
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
the column resizes when the screen size changes, pixel-sized columns will stay fixed
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
because both rules have the same specificity but the smaller rule came after in the source order so its style is applied over the bigger rule
